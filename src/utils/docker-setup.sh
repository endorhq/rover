You are an expert software architect tasked with creating a detailed implementation plan for changes to a codebase. Your output will be a \`/output/planning.md\` file that serves as a comprehensive document for implementing the requested changes. Remember to write this file after you conclude the planning.

## User request

The user provided this description you must create the plan for:

=================
Title: $TASK_TITLE

$TASK_DESCRIPTION
=================

## Planning

Analyze the requested change and create an implementation plan that includes:

### 1. Change Overview
- **Objective**: Clear statement of what needs to be accomplished
- **Scope**: Boundaries of the change (what's included/excluded). Minimize the changes and stay focused on the user task.

### 2. Implementation Strategy
Break down the implementation into logical steps. Just provide a list with the different steps to complete this task. Keep it short, concise and simple.

### 3. Implementation Checklist
Create a sequential checklist that can be followed:
- [ ] Pre-implementation setup
- [ ] Core implementation tasks (numbered and ordered)
- [ ] Testing and validation
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Output Format

Your planning.md should be:
- Written in clear, actionable language
- Concise language
- Include code snippets where helpful
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Include mermaid diagrams for complex flows when required

Remember: The goal is to create a concise and detailed plan that another developer could implement the changes without additional context. Be specific, thorough, and anticipate edge cases. Finally, save the plan into the /output/planning.md file located at the system root.

# Create implementation prompt
cat >> /output/prompt.txt << END
Based on the planning document at /output/planning.md, implement all the changes described in the plan.

Follow these guidelines:
1. Execute each phase as outlined in the plan
2. Make all necessary file modifications
3. Create any new files required
4. Follow the exact implementation strategy from the planning document
5. Ensure all changes are functional and complete

After implmenting all the changes, write a /output/implementation.md document that summarizes the applied changes and provides a list with the changed files.

# Create validation prompt

Validate the implementation in /output/planning.md by:

1. Running any existing tests mentioned in the planning document
2. Verifying that all changes from the plan have been applied
3. Checking for any syntax errors or type issues
4. Ensuring the code follows the project's conventions

Only add or run tests if the project already includes a testing suite.

Write a validation report to /output/validation.md that includes:
- Test results (if applicable)
- Verification of each planned change
- Any issues found and how they were resolved
- Confirmation that the implementation matches the plan

Create a comprehensive summary of the completed task and save it to /output/summary.md.

The summary should include:

1. **Executive Summary** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Brief description of what was accomplished
   - Key outcomes and improvements

2. **Files Modified**
   List each file that was changed with a brief description of the changes:
   - 'path/to/file.ext': Description of changes

3. **Files Added**
   List any new files created:
   - 'path/to/newfile.ext': Purpose of the file

4. **Implementation Details**
   - Key technical decisions made
   - Any deviations from the original plan and why

5. **Testing Results**
   - Summary of tests run and results
   - Any validation performed
