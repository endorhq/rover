Rover is a **manager for AI coding agents that works with Claude Code, Gemini, and Qwen**.

It helps you get more done, faster, by allowing **multiple agents to work on your codebase simultaneously**. The agents work in the background in separate, isolated environments: they don't interfere with your work or each other.

**Rover does not change how you work**: everything runs locally, under your control, and using your already installed tools.

## Getting Started

First, install Rover and initialize it in your project:

```sh
# Install
npm install -g @endorhq/rover@latest

# Initialize
cd <your-project> && rover init .
```

_The init step does not change anything on your codebase or operating system. Rover checks what type of project it is and which coding agents and development tools you use (such as Docker)._

Then, run `rover task` to create a task describing what you want to accomplish and hand it to Rover.

Rover will:

- üîí Prepare a **local isolated environment** (using containers) with an independent copy of your project code
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Install and configure** your preferred AI coding agent in that environment
- ü§ñ Setup a workflow for the agent to complete the task and **run it in the background until it finishes**

Depending on the task complexity, it might take a few minutes. Meanwhile, you **can create new tasks to also run in parallel** or simply relax, step back and do some other work, whether on your computer or away from it!

## Why Rover?

Running and managing multiple AI coding agents simultaneously can be overwhelming. You need to run them isolated from each other and they constantly ask for attention. **Context switching quickly becomes a productivity drain**.

At the same time, **parallel execution is one of the most powerful capabilities of AI coding agents**. You can focus on a task while a team of agents complete small issues or just write some new documentation.

To simplify this process, **Rover manages AI coding agents on your behalf**. It integrates with both your terminal and VSCode (as an extension). Configure Rover in your repository, set up your preferred AI coding agent and create new tasks with a single command. Rover will take care of setting up an environment for every task and configure your AI agent to complete it.

### Main features

- üöÄ **Easy to use**: Manage multiple AI coding agents working on different tasks with a single command
- üîí **Isolated**: Prevent AI Agents from overriding your changes, accessing private information or deleting system files
- ü§ñ **Bring your AI agents**: Use your existing AI agents like Claude Code, Gemini, and Qwen. **No new subscriptions needed**
- üíª **Local**: Everything runs on your computer. No new apps and permissions in your repositories
- üëê **Open Source**: Released under the Apache 2 license

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

You need at least one supported AI agent in your system:

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup)
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation)
- [Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

### Installation

Install it using `npm`:

```sh
npm install -g @endorhq/rover@latest
```

### First steps

1. Initialize Rover in your project:

   ```sh
   cd <your-project> && rover init .
   ```

2. Create your first task with Rover:

   ```sh
   rover task
   ```

3. Check the status of your task:

   ```sh
   rover ls -w
   ```

4. Keep working on your own tasks ü§ì

5. After finishing, check the task result:

   ```sh
   rover inspect 1
   rover inspect 1 --file changes.md
   rover diff 1
   ```

6. If you want to apply more changes, create a second iteration with new instructions:

   ```sh
   rover iterate 1
   ```

7. If you need to apply changes manually, jump into the task workspace:

   ```sh
   rover shell 1
   ```

8. If changes are fine, you can:
   - Merge them:

   ```sh
   rover merge 1
   ```

   - Push the branch to the remote using your git configuration:

   ```sh
   rover push 1
   ```

   - Take manual control:

   ```sh
   rover shell 1
   git status
   ```

> üí° TIP: You can run multiple tasks in parallel. Just take into account your AI agents' limits.

## How it works

**Rover relies on local tools you already have like Git, Docker/Podman and AI coding agents**. When you initialize it in a project (using `rover init`), it identifies the project requirements and the available tools in your environment.

Once you create a task, Rover creates a separate _git worktree_ (`workspace`) and branch for that task. It starts a container, mounts the required files, installs tools, configures them, and lets your AI agent complete a workflow. Rover workflows are a set of predefined steps for AI coding agents. Depending on the workflow, you might get a set of changes in the workspace or a document with research.

After an AI agent finishes the task, all code changes and output documents are available in the task workspace (_git worktree_). You can inspect those documents, check changes, iterate with an AI agent, or even take full control and start applying changes manually. **Every developer has a different workflow, and Rover won't interfere with it**.

Once you are ready, you can merge changes or push the branch. That's it! üöÄ
