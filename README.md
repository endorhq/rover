Rover is a **manager for AI coding agents that works with Claude Code, Gemini, and Qwen**. It helps you get more done, faster, by allowing multiple agents to work on your codebase in the background without interfering with you or each other.

Everything runs locally, under your control, and using your already installed tools.

## Getting Started

First, install Rover and initialize your project:

```sh
npm install -g @endorhq/rover@latest && rover init .
```

Then, create a task describing what you want to accomplish in your existing project and hand it to Rover:

Rover will:

- Prepare a **local isolated environment** (using containers) with a separate copy of your project
- Install and configure the AI coding agent in that environment
- Setup a workflow for the agent to complete the task and run it in the background until it finishes

Depending on the task complexity, it might take a few minutes. Meanwhile, you can create new tasks to also run in parallel to the existing one or simply relax, step back and do some other work, either in the computer or real life!

## Why Rover?

Running and managing multiple AI coding agents at the same time is overwhelming. You need to run them isolated and they constantly ask for attention. **The context switch is a nightmare**. At the same time, **parallelization is best benefit of AI coding agents**. You can focus on a task while agents complete small issues or just write some new documentation.

To simplify this process, **Rover manages AI coding agents for you**. It integrates with both your terminal and VSCode (as an extension). Configure Rover in your repository, setup your preferred AI coding agent and create new tasks with a single command.

Rover will take care of setting up an environment for every task and configure your AI agent to complete it.

### Main features

- üöÄ **Easy to use**: Manage multiple AI coding agents working on different tasks with a single command
- üîí **Isolated**: Prevent AI Agents from overriding your changes, accessing private information or deleting system files
- ü§ñ **Bring your AI Agents**: Use your existing AI agents like Claude Code, Gemini, and Qwen. **No new subscriptions needed**
- üíª **Local**: Everything runs on your computer. No new apps and permissions in your repositories

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

You need at least one supported AI Agent in your system:

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup)
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation)
- [Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

### Installation

Install it using `npm`:

```sh
npm install -g @endorhq/rover@latest
```

### First steps

1. Initialize Rover in your project:

   ```sh
   cd your-project && rover init
   ```

2. Create your first task with Rover:

   ```sh
   rover task
   ```

3. Check the status of your task:

   ```sh
   rover ls -w
   ```

4. Keep working on your own tasks ü§ì

5. After finishing, check the task result:

   ```sh
   rover inspect 1
   rover inspect 1 --file changes.md
   rover diff 1
   ```

6. If you want to apply more changes, create a second iteration with new instructions:

   ```sh
   rover iterate 1
   ```

7. If changes are fine, you can:
   - Merge them:

   ```sh
   rover merge 1
   ```

   - Push the branch to the remote using your git configuration:

   ```sh
   rover push 1
   ```

   - Take manual control:

   ```sh
   rover shell 1
   git status
   ```

> üí° TIP: You can run multiple tasks in parallel. Just take into account your AI agents' limits.

## How it works

Rover relies on the local tools you already have like Git, Docker/Podman and AI Coding Agents. When you initialize it in a project (using `rover init`), it identifies the project and the available tools in your environment. Then, you can start assigning tasks to your agents.

Once you create a task, Rover creates a separate _git worktree_ (`workspace`) and branch for that task. Then, it starts a container, mounts the required files, installs tools, configures them, and lets your AI agent complete a workflow.

Rover workflows provide a set of predefined steps to a AI coding agent. Depending on the workflow, you might get a set of changes in the workspace or a document with research. We recommend exploring the different workflows to get the maximum benefit from your AI Agents.

After an AI agent finishes the task, all code changes and output documents are available in the task workspace. You can inspect those documents, check changes, iterate with an AI agent, or even take full control and start applying changes manually.

Every developer has a different workflow, and Rover will not get in between.

Once you are ready, you can merge changes or push the branch. That's it! üöÄ
