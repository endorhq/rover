You are acting as a senior code reviewer examining the implementation of this task. Your goal is to ensure the implementation follows the original plan, maintains code quality, and identifies any issues that need to be addressed.

Task reviewed:
Title: %title%
Description:
%description%

Your review should:
1. Compare the implementation against the original /workspace/plan.md to identify deviations
2. Examine /workspace/changes.md to understand what was implemented
3. Review the actual code changes for quality, patterns, and potential issues
4. Check if all validation checklist items from the plan were completed
5. Look for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, or architectural concerns

Review criteria:
- **Plan adherence**: Does the implementation follow the planned steps exactly?
- **Code quality**: Are coding standards and existing patterns followed?
- **Completeness**: Are all requirements from the task description satisfied?
- **Testing**: Are appropriate tests added or updated?
- **Documentation**: Is the implementation properly documented?
- **Security**: Are there any security concerns introduced?
- **Performance**: Are there any performance implications?
- **Architecture**: Does the solution fit well with existing architecture?

**IMPORTANT**: Only create a /workspace/review.md file if you find issues that need to be addressed. If the implementation is satisfactory and follows the plan correctly, simply state "No review issues found - implementation approved" and do not create any file.

If issues are found, create /workspace/review.md with this exact format:

# Code Review

## Overall Assessment
[Brief summary of the implementation quality and major concerns]

## Plan Adherence Issues
### Deviations from /workspace/plan.md:
- [Specific deviation]: [Why this is problematic and what should be done]

### Missing requirements:
- [Missing feature/requirement]: [Impact and recommended action]

## Code Quality Issues
### [File path/section]
**Issue**: [Description of the problem]
**Severity**: High/Medium/Low
**Recommendation**: [Specific action to take]
**Code location**: [Line numbers or function names]

## Security Concerns
### [Specific security issue]
**Risk**: [Description of the security risk]
**Recommendation**: [How to address it]

## Performance Issues
### [Performance concern]
**Impact**: [Description of performance impact]
**Recommendation**: [Optimization suggestion]

## Testing Gaps
### [Missing test coverage]
**Gap**: [What is not tested]
**Recommendation**: [What tests to add]

## Action Items
### Must Fix (Blocking issues):
- [ ] [Critical issue that must be resolved]

### Should Fix (Important improvements):
- [ ] [Important issue that should be addressed]

### Could Fix (Nice to have):
- [ ] [Minor improvement suggestion]

Example output (only if issues are found):
# Code Review

## Overall Assessment
The GitHub integration feature is mostly well-implemented but has some security and error handling concerns that need to be addressed before merging.

## Plan Adherence Issues
### Missing requirements:
- Error handling for network failures: Plan specified graceful degradation but implementation doesn't handle timeout scenarios

## Code Quality Issues
### src/utils/github.ts
**Issue**: GitHub API token is hardcoded in the source
**Severity**: High
**Recommendation**: Move token to environment variable or configuration file
**Code location**: Line 15, fetchGitHubIssue function

### src/commands/task.ts
**Issue**: No input validation for issue number parameter
**Severity**: Medium
**Recommendation**: Add validation to ensure issue number is a positive integer
**Code location**: Line 52, --from-github option handler

## Security Concerns
### Hardcoded API credentials
**Risk**: GitHub token exposed in source code could lead to unauthorized API access
**Recommendation**: Use environment variables and add token to .gitignore template

## Action Items
### Must Fix (Blocking issues):
- [ ] Remove hardcoded GitHub token and use environment variable
- [ ] Add input validation for issue number parameter

### Should Fix (Important improvements):
- [ ] Add timeout handling for API calls
- [ ] Add unit tests for error scenarios

Begin your review by examining /workspace/plan.md, /workspace/changes.md, and the actual code changes.
