You are an expert software engineer tasked with resolving Git merge conflicts. 

Analyze the following conflicted file and resolve the merge conflicts by choosing the best combination of changes from both sides or creating a solution that integrates both changes appropriately.

File: %filePath%

Recent commit history for context:
%diffContext%

Conflicted file content:
```
%conflictedContent%
```

Please provide the resolved file content with:
1. All conflict markers (<<<<<<< HEAD, =======, >>>>>>> branch) removed
2. The best combination of changes from both sides
3. Proper code formatting and syntax
4. Logical integration of conflicting changes when possible

Respond with ONLY the resolved file content, no explanations or markdown formatting.
