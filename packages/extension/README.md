# Rover VSCode Extension

**Rover** is a manager for AI coding agents that works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Qwen. It helps you get more done, faster, by allowing multiple agents to work on your codebase simultaneously.

This VSCode extension brings Rover's power directly to your editor. Run multiple coding agents in parallel on different tasks while you keep working. Everything runs locally in isolated environments, giving you full control over your development workflow.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create and monitor AI agent tasks from the sidebar
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple agents simultaneously in isolated environments
- **Real-time Updates**: Track task progress and status in real-time
- **Quick Actions**: Merge changes, push branches, or inspect results with one click
- **Integrated Terminal**: Jump into task workspaces directly from VSCode
