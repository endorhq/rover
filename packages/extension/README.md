## Requirements

### Prerequisites

- **Rover CLI**: The extension requires the Rover CLI tool to be installed on your system
- **Git**: Git must be available for repository and branch management
- **Node.js**: Required for running AI agents (Node.js 20+)

### Installation Steps

1. Install the Rover CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @endor/rover
   ```
2. Install this VS Code extension from the marketplace
3. Configure the CLI path in settings if needed (see Extension Settings)

### Optional Requirements

- **GitHub CLI (gh)**: For enhanced GitHub integration and PR creation
- **AI Provider API Keys**: Configure Claude or Gemini API keys for AI functionality

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `rover.cliPath`: Path to the Rover CLI executable
  - **Default**: `"rover"`
  - **Description**: Specify the path to the Rover CLI if it's not in your system PATH
  - **Example**: `"/usr/local/bin/rover"` or `"C:\\tools\\rover.exe"`

- `rover.autoRefreshInterval`: Auto-refresh interval in milliseconds
  - **Default**: `5000` (5 seconds)
  - **Description**: How often the task list refreshes automatically. Set to 0 to disable auto-refresh
  - **Range**: 0 (disabled) to 60000ms (1 minute)

## Commands

The extension provides the following commands accessible via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`):

### Task Management

- **Rover: Create Task** - Create a new AI-powered task
- **Rover: Create Task from GitHub Issue** - Import a GitHub issue as a task
- **Rover: Refresh Tasks** - Manually refresh the task list
- **Rover: Delete Task** - Remove a task and clean up its resources

### Task Operations

- **Rover: Inspect Task** - Open detailed task information panel
- **Rover: View Task Logs** - Show execution logs for a task
- **Rover: Open Task Shell** - Launch interactive terminal in task workspace
- **Rover: Open Task Workspace** - Switch to task workspace folder
- **Rover: Git Compare Task Workspace** - Compare task changes with main branch

### Git Operations

- **Rover: Push Task Branch** - Push task changes and optionally create PR
- **Rover: Merge Task** - Merge task into current branch with AI assistance

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Rover in Your Project

```bash
rover init
```

### 2. Create Your First Task

1. Click the Rover icon in the Activity Bar
2. Click the "+" button or use "Rover: Create Task" command
3. Describe your task in natural language
4. Watch as the AI agent completes your task!

### 3. Monitor Progress

- Task status updates automatically in the tree view
- Click on any task to see detailed information
- Use the logs view to see real-time execution details

### 4. Review and Merge

- Use the diff view to review changes
- Merge completed tasks with AI-powered conflict resolution
- Push changes and create PRs directly from VS Code

## Usage Tips

### Best Practices

- **Be specific in task descriptions**: The more detail you provide, the better the AI agent can understand your requirements
- **Use iterations**: Add refinements to running tasks if the initial results need adjustment
- **Review before merging**: Always check the diff and test changes before merging tasks
- **Clean up completed tasks**: Delete finished tasks to keep your workspace organized

### Troubleshooting

- **CLI not found**: Check the `rover.cliPath` setting if the extension can't find the Rover CLI
- **Tasks not updating**: Verify the auto-refresh interval setting or manually refresh
- **Permission issues**: Ensure the Rover CLI has proper permissions and Git is configured
- **AI API errors**: Check your API key configuration in the Rover CLI

## Known Issues

- **Large repositories**: Initial task creation may be slower on very large codebases
- **Windows paths**: Use double backslashes or forward slashes in `rover.cliPath` on Windows
- **Terminal integration**: Some terminals may not properly inherit environment variables
